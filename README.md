# Student Management System

## Contributed to this open source project at ACM's Hacknight 6.0 at PESUECC
### Overview
This is a  Django-based Student Management System  designed to manage students, professors, courses, and grades in an academic setting. It leverages Django's ORM to interact with a PostgreSQL database, providing models to store information about students, courses, professors, and scores. The system also includes authentication, permissions, and session management through Django's built-in models.

   ```

7.  Run the development server :
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

8.  Access the app :
   - Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to access the system.
   - Use the admin interface at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` to manage data.

## Usage

-  Admin Interface :
